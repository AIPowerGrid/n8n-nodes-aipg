# n8n-nodes-aipg - n8n community node

## Purpose

Native n8n community node for AI Power Grid text, image, video, and audio
generation. This package uses only the documented production `/v1` API and
keeps Grid credentials in n8n's encrypted credential store.

## Local Contracts

- Keep the production API base fixed to `https://api.aipowergrid.io/v1` and
  disable redirects on authenticated requests.
- Never expose a custom remote base URL or place API keys in node parameters.
- Discover text models from `/v1/models` and media models from
  `/v1/status/models`; do not hard-code availability claims.
- Ordinary n8n node executions return completed responses. Do not claim that
  this node relays token streaming through the editor.
- Preserve Core's bounds for token, image, video, and audio inputs. Unsupported
  source-media workflows must remain absent rather than silently dropping data.
- HTTP errors, including `401`, `402`, `404`, `422`, `429`, and `503`, must be
  surfaced to n8n so workflow error branches can handle them.
- Credential validation must call an authenticated, read-only endpoint. Public
  model discovery cannot prove that a key is valid.
- `CREATOR_PORTAL_SUBMISSION.md` owns the current provenance and verified-node
  intake checklist. A prepared checklist is not npm publication or Creator
  Portal acceptance.
- `CREATOR_PORTAL_DEMO.md` owns the manual-review recording procedure, and
  `examples/creator-portal-review.json` is its credential-free workflow. Keep
  both pinned to the exact public package under review and free of secrets,
  account identifiers, wallet addresses, and credential IDs.

## Verification

- `npm ci`
- `npm test`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- `npm pack --dry-run`
- `AIPG_LIVE_E2E=1 npm run test:e2e:live` (explicitly authorized disposable
  key and credit spend only)
- This dedicated repository is the canonical source for the npm package. Do
  not make package changes in the former `grid-provider-integrations`
  subdirectory.
- Publish only through `.github/workflows/publish.yml` using a matching
  `n8n-nodes-aipg-vX.Y.Z` tag. Do not bypass provenance with local publishing.
