# n8n Creator Portal Submission

## Package

- npm name: `@aipowergrid/n8n-nodes-aipg`
- current npm version: `0.1.3`
- canonical source: `AIPowerGrid/n8n-nodes-aipg`
- license: MIT
- operations: completed text, image, video, and audio generation
- credential: encrypted bearer key with `account.read` and
  `inference.submit`

## Publication path

`@aipowergrid/n8n-nodes-aipg@0.1.3` was published from this dedicated
repository with npm provenance using tag `n8n-nodes-aipg-v0.1.3`. Its Trusted
Publisher is:

- repository owner: `AIPowerGrid`
- repository: `n8n-nodes-aipg`
- workflow: `publish.yml`

The public package resolves to commit `c90d980`, and n8n's official
`@n8n/scan-community-package` scanner passes provenance, source retrieval, and
package security checks for `0.1.3`. A clean n8n `2.36.8` instance already
discovered and loaded all four operations from the package.

## Creator Portal evidence

- The official `@n8n/scan-community-package` scanner passes the public npm
  package, its GitHub provenance, the attested TypeScript source, and the
  shipped JavaScript artifact.
- `npm run lint`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, and `npm pack --dry-run` pass.
- The package has no runtime dependencies, as required for verified community
  nodes.
- A clean local n8n editor lists all four operations.
- The credential test calls authenticated read-only `/account/credits`; public
  model discovery is not used as proof that a key is valid.
- One bounded live request per advertised operation passes through the exact
  built transport with a disposable scoped key.
- HTTP `401`, `402`, `404`, `422`, `429`, and `503` remain visible to workflow
  error branches.
- Documentation states that standard n8n executions return completed text and
  do not relay token streaming through the editor.
- Documentation states that plaintext requests may be inspected by remote
  community workers and makes no n8n partnership claim.

The package and provenance are public. It was submitted, then resubmitted, to
the Creator Portal on 2026-08-30. The package's portal page is
[`/nodes/@aipowergrid%2Fn8n-nodes-aipg/integration`](https://creators.n8n.io/nodes/@aipowergrid%2Fn8n-nodes-aipg/integration).
The first automated review reported **Changes Required** with one finding:
`Can't find credential file in repo`. The credential source exists at
`n8n-nodes-aipg/credentials/AipgApi.credentials.ts` in npm's attested source
commit, while the published package contains
`dist/credentials/AipgApi.credentials.js`. The npm metadata uses the standard
`repository.directory: n8n-nodes-aipg` monorepo field, but the portal did not
resolve it. Version `0.1.3` therefore points npm directly at this dedicated
repository, where `credentials/AipgApi.credentials.ts` is at the root.

The resubmitted `0.1.3` package has now passed the Creator Portal's automated
review. The portal currently reports **Manual Review: Awaiting Video** and asks
for one uncut demonstration of npm installation, credential validation, a
common operation, and one AI-agent tool action. This is not manual approval,
Creator Portal acceptance, permission to publish as verified, or n8n
endorsement. Do not claim acceptance until the portal reports **Approved For
Publish**.

### Reverification on 2026-08-30

- `npx @n8n/scan-community-package @aipowergrid/n8n-nodes-aipg` passed
  provenance, source retrieval, and package security checks for public version
  `0.1.3`.
- The scanner resolved the attested source to repository commit `c90d980`.
- `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and `npm pack --dry-run` passed after updating
  the development-only `@n8n/node-cli` toolchain to `0.46.0` on `main`.
- `npm audit --omit=dev` reports zero production dependency advisories. The
  published package still has no runtime dependencies.

## Portal field pack

The values below are the copy used for the submitted package. The Creator
Portal's current field names and package status remain authoritative.

- **npm package:** `@aipowergrid/n8n-nodes-aipg`
- **Display name:** `AI Power Grid`
- **Short description:** `Generate text, images, video, and audio with community-powered models through the AI Power Grid API.`
- **Category:** `AI`
- **Source repository:** `https://github.com/AIPowerGrid/n8n-nodes-aipg`
- **Documentation:** `https://github.com/AIPowerGrid/n8n-nodes-aipg#readme`
- **API key console:** `https://console.aipowergrid.io/dashboard/api-key`
- **Support:** `https://github.com/AIPowerGrid/n8n-nodes-aipg/issues`
- **License:** `MIT`

Long description:

> AI Power Grid connects n8n workflows to open text, image, video, and audio
> models served by community-operated workers. The node discovers currently
> available models, keeps API credentials in n8n's encrypted credential store,
> returns completed generation responses, and surfaces Grid HTTP errors to
> normal workflow error branches. Requests are sent to remote workers, so users
> should not submit secrets or regulated data without a separately verified
> confidential-compute deployment.

Do not claim Creator Portal acceptance, n8n endorsement, token streaming, or
confidential inference in the submission.

## Portal submission

`@aipowergrid/n8n-nodes-aipg` was submitted through
[creators.n8n.io/nodes](https://creators.n8n.io/nodes). The current official
requirements are satisfied:

- scoped package name follows `@<scope>/n8n-nodes-*`
- `n8n-community-node-package` keyword and `n8n` manifest entries are present
- public MIT source repository matches npm metadata
- package has no runtime dependencies or file-system/environment access
- English README includes credentials, operations, examples, errors, and
  privacy guidance
- publication comes from GitHub Actions with npm provenance

The Creator Portal may email an ownership token to the package author or
maintainer address. Never place that token in source, issues, screenshots, or
workflow JSON. Portal submission does not require an npm login or npm token.
